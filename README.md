# Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Here, you'll find an overview of three applications I have developed, each showcasing progressive levels of complexity and features. These projects demonstrate my journey in software development, from basic templating to fully deployable solutions with integrated observability.

## 1. **Simple Templating App**

### Description
This app is a straightforward web application designed to use static templates for rendering content. It focuses on:
- Minimalistic design.
- Efficient use of HTML templates.
- Fast loading and lightweight performance.

### Features
- Uses HTML/CSS for structure and styling.
- No backend complexityâ€”perfect for understanding templating basics.

### Purpose
This project demonstrates my understanding of creating and managing static web content efficiently.

## 2. **Database-Integrated App**

### Description
This app introduces database functionality to store, retrieve, and manipulate data dynamically. It is built using a backend framework to handle CRUD operations effectively.

### Features
- Integration with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
- Secure and scalable data handling.
- User authentication and session management.
- Backend logic to handle dynamic requests.

### Purpose
This project highlights my ability to integrate and manage databases, ensuring robust and scalable application development.

## 3. **Deployment-Ready App with Observability**

### Description
This is my most advanced project, designed to be production-ready with built-in observability tools for monitoring and logging. It showcases best practices in deployment and operational readiness.

### Features
- Deployment on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP).
- Observability integration using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack.
- Microservices architecture for scalability and modularity.
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.

### Purpose
This project demonstrates my proficiency in end-to-end application development, including cloud deployment, scalability, and observability to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
